# Personal Scratchpad – Learning, Practice, Experiments

## What This Repository Is

This repository is a living workspace rather than a polished portfolio.

It serves as a single place where I:

* Practice fundamentals
* Solve coding problems
* Take learning notes
* Experiment with ideas
* Build small, focused mini-projects to deeply understand specific concepts

The structure reflects *how I actually learn*: iteratively and by oscillating between theory, practice, and experimentation.

## How to Read This Repo

This repo is not meant to be consumed top-to-bottom.

Different directories represent different modes of learning:

* Deliberate practice
* Skill reinforcement
* Note-taking
* Focused problem-solving
* Exploratory mini-projects

Each folder is intentionally lightweight and mostly self-contained.

## Directory Overview

### `CodeWarsSolutions/`

---

### `HackerRank/`

---

### `learning-notes/`

Structured notes collected over time.

Contains:

* Course notes
* Laravel-specific learning
* TILs (Today I Learned)
* University lecture notes

Purpose:

* Externalize understanding
* Capture insights before they fade
* Build a personal reference library

---

### `workbooks/`

Practice sets and exercises grouped by topic.

Examples:

* Data structures and algorithms
* Python practice

Purpose:

* Repetition with intent
* Turning theory into executable understanding

These are closer to notebooks or drills than finished code.

---

### `miniprojects/`

Small, focused projects designed to deeply explore a **single idea or constraint**.

Examples:

* Passport photo validation using deterministic computer vision heuristics

Purpose:

* Drill one concept at a time
* Explore real-world edge cases
* Build intuition through constraints

Each mini-project typically includes its own README explaining the problem, approach, and trade-offs.

---

## Philosophy

This repository reflects *progress*, not just outcomes.

---

## What This Is Not

* Not a showcase of best practices everywhere
* Not a curated portfolio
* Not production-grade across the board

Instead, it is an honest record of how I think, learn, and iterate.

---

## Why Keep Everything Together

Keeping problems, notes, drills, and experiments in one place makes it easier to:

* Revisit earlier mental models
* Connect ideas across domains

This repo is less about presentation and more about continuity.

---

## Final Note

If you’re browsing this as an external reader:

* Start with `miniprojects/`
* Then skim `learning-notes/`
* Treat everything else as raw practice material
