## Context
Hey Claude,
I'm creating Anki flashcards to build muscle memory for [Topic/Subject]. I want to use spaced repetition to internalize the 20% of patterns I'll use 80% of the time.

Requirements:
Each card should have a QUICK answer I can type in 10-15 seconds max
Focus on high-ROI patterns I'll use constantly (daily/weekly)
The context/scenario should be realistic work situations (what would a PM/team lead ask you to do)
The cloze deletion (what I type) should be SHORT
Don't number the cards (no "Card 1:", "Card 2:", etc.) - just the scenario and the code

Mix of two card types:
Quick recall cards: Single line completions (e.g., "Get first item from list: items.{{c1::first()}}")
Scenario cards: Multi-step workflows with multiple cloze deletions showing real-world usage

Areas to cover:
Most common shortcuts/helpers (the stuff I'll type 100 times a day)
Performance patterns (things that prevent common mistakes)
Idiomatic syntax (modern best practices for the language/framework)
Common workflows (the patterns that repeat in every project)
Things I will frequently look up in docs

Format:
Use cloze deletion format: {{c1::answer}} for single blanks, {{c1::part1}} {{c2::part2}} for multi-step
Start each card with a realistic scenario/task description, then show the code

What NOT to include:
Overly complex edge cases
Rarely-used features

Give me 50-80 cards covering the absolute essentials. Prioritize speed of recall over completeness.
