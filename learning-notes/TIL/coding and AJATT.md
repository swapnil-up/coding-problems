# coding and AJATT

I get to learn svelte, fastapi and docker. Having come from laravel vue, it's a lot of new stuff and I think I realize that my thing is that I like to have some sort of flow with learning. Here's where my head is at  currently.


do anki via three decks or sections that come one after another: 

1. lingo deck to understand the key terms and what they say

2. then a conceptual mental models/ and why deck to understand stuff from first principles

3. then all of the implementation details, gotchas and so on via lil coding snippets that test what'll happen/ where's the bug


Then you do beginner small projects, prolly lots of ai/llm while building, and read docs when you reach new concepts and go between the two. 



THe interesting here though is that the process is eerily similar to how all the language nerds go about learning languages. You do a core vocab deck, then i+1 sentences, and for grammar you don't learn by memorizing rules, you just hear them once then just see them in action. 

After a point all you do is immersion to build stuff, and convert the i+1 stuff into anki and build a mastery. If you're following ajatt that number would be 10K sentences. Prolly much smaller to be a competent dev at any one of these things though.
