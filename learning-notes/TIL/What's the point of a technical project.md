Today I "coded" with an AI in my editor. It kept on writing all the code, I was trying to learn a new paradigm but it rapidly went through phases while I was there just staring. I started from scratch while building with it in my browser instead. A fine line between avoiding boiler plate while still learning. 

But given that you could make a CV worthy project for a mid level role in a few days are there any reasons to make projects for the most part, when it's not driven by a need to show off your solution to a problem. So maybe one reason is actually to use it to share thoughts. 

Write about new concepts you learnt, new opinions you have. Post in on your blog then link in the readme. But I don't write. Meh. Just write a heading, one line and post it. You can add onto it later. You have a fucking version control dammit. Iterate on the articles and upload again. You have 0 fucking viewers anyway. Who cares?
