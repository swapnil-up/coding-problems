# Missing semester MIT

A good way to think about this course the following comment on HN:

"I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it." -- Bill Gates

Some people just accept absurd drudgery interacting with computers; it never even occurs to them to seek an easier way. But if you can teach the students to be "lazy" when it comes to that kind of repetitive drudgery, they'll be set for life. It's stuff like realizing how great 

	xset r rate 180 60

with this, now pressing down on a key makes it repeat with a fwoosh instead of just a light jog. Need to take a minute to get used to the new sensitivity though. Double pressing some letters here and there. 

Another way to think about this is that this is a course on computer literacy rather than computer science. Just like how we had to slog through excel, word and loops in qbasic as kids and then using the computer was much easier as compared to say our parents, through this course we're able to take it up a notch from knowing just the basics of our system to knowing it's bowels and how to operate withiinnnnn.
